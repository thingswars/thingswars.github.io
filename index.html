<p>ThingsWars is a project dedicated to programming challenges and AI competitions that allow both low-level and high-level techniques to be used.</p>

<p>The broad theme is the 'Internet of Things': smart watches and smart thermostats and all these embedded devices which are becoming more common (and more creepy, to some!). The idea is to use the same kind of resources available to those devices, to solve interesting programming problems and play games. By giving everyone the same limited resources, not only do competitors have to be clever about how they use resources, but also everyone is on an equal footing. You can't win just by throwing lots of CPU and memory at the problem!</p>

<p>ThingsWars is inspired by <a href="http://aichallenge.org/">AI Challenge</a> and <a href="http://www.corewars.org/">Core Wars</a>.</p>

<p>The project is in its infancy. For now the most interesting this the <a href="https://github.com/thingswars/johnnyriscv">Java RISC-V emulator</a> that is being actively developed.</p>
